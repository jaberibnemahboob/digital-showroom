              <p>
                Our basic philosophy is to create something that appeals to people in their own special way - which adds something extra to them without adding anything superfluous. In our design we draw on nomadism - the idea of ​​always walking and being prepared to move on - and to do it with pleasure. Therefore, our designs are designed to fit into different contexts and to be easily moved. They will stand out in any interior, like objects that create both comfort and joy in our everyday lives.

                    All our furniture where wood is included is produced in beautiful Slovenia. A country like in many areas less about the time when Danish agriculture consisted of many small farms and thus the variation in the cultural landscape. Furniture production in the same way, since Danish furniture production for several decades consisted mostly of several hundred small family-owned companies spread throughout the country.

                    Our office, product development department and photo studio are located in Fredensborg, north of Copenhagen, where the Danish Queen has one of his residences. The building dates from 1857 and served as a detention house and court building for 100 years. Outstanding is that the house of arrest is still almost unchanged from that time and we therefore feel privileged that since 2013 we have had all 13 cells as well as the other facilities of the place and at the same time a neighbor to the Queen's Garden.
